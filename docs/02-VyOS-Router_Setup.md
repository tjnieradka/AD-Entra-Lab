# 02.VyOS Router Setup

## 1. Introduction

VyOS 1.3 is an open-source, Debian-based network operating system used for routing, firewalling, NAT, DHCP, and VPN services. In this lab, VyOS 1.3 virtual machine acts as the edge router and zone-based firewall, separating the LAN, DMZ, and NAT interfaces. It simulates enterprise-class network segmentation and enforces access rules between on-premises and cloud-connected components (e.g., Entra Connect â†’ Entra ID).

## 2. VyOS 1.3 Configuration

The following are commands used to configure the VyOS router and firewall for the lab. The main objective is to allow connectivity between the on-premise Active Directory and Entra.  
```

## 3. Ports

Here is a summary of why specific ports were configured.

Entra Connect Port Requirements (update needed)

**LAN â†’ WAN** 
| Protocol | Port | Description                                          | Notes                                 |
|----------|------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| TCP      | 443  | HTTPS (Azure AD Connect to Entra endpoints)         | Mandatory for sync, token auth, etc.  |
| TCP      | 80   | HTTP (Redirect or telemetry)                        | Optional â€“ used for fallback/redirect |
| TCP      | 389  | LDAP to on-prem AD (internal)                       | LAN only â€“ for AD sync                |
| TCP      | 88   | Kerberos auth to domain controller                  | LAN only                              |
| TCP      | 445  | SMB (Group Policy, logon scripts)                   | LAN only â€“ avoid exposing externally  |
| UDP      | 123  | NTP (Time sync with Internet or internal NTP)       | Needed if no internal NTP             |

icmp port opened for diagnostics in the lab.

**WAN â†’ LAN** 

None normally required -All sync is outbound only from LAN 

**DMZ â†’ LAN**
