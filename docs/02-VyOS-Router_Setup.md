# 02.VyOS Router Setup

## 1. Introduction

VyOS 1.3 is an open-source, Debian-based network operating system used for routing, firewalling, NAT, DHCP, and VPN services. In this lab, VyOS 1.3 virtual machine acts as the edge router and zone-based firewall, separating the LAN, DMZ, and NAT interfaces. It simulates enterprise-class network segmentation and enforces access rules between on-premises and cloud-connected components (e.g., Entra Connect ‚Üí Entra ID).

## 2. Overview VyOS 1.3 Configuration

The following configurations were done on VyOS for the lab.  Note that some of the settings were done because this is a lab where VMware environment is shut down when not in use (ie., this is not a production system that stays online).  Some rulesets where done to allow various tests (e.g., ICMP was enabled to allow pings and debugging).

**1. Interfaces**
The VyOS router in this lab is configured with three network interfaces, each representing a separate network zone (set up as different VMware VLANs/virtual networks):
**eth0 (WAN):**
- Assigned via DHCP from the VMware NAT or bridged network.
- Represents the external interface used for internet access.
**eth1 (LAN):**
- Statically assigned the subnet 192.168.10.1/24.
- Used for internal (trusted) client devices such as AD, Windows, Linux clients.
**eth2 (DMZ)**
- Statically assigned the subnet 192.168.20.1/24.
- Used for semi-public or isolated servers (e.g., web servers).
These interfaces are mapped to separate VMware virtual networks (or VLANs) to simulate zone isolation. The WAN uses the VMware-provided NAT network for internet access.

**2. Masquerading**
Two masquerade rulesets were set up.
Masquerading is a type of Network Address Translation (NAT) that allows internal devices (in LAN or DMZ) to access the internet by sharing the VyOS router's WAN IP address.
It rewrites the source IP of outgoing packets to match the WAN interface IP.  In the this lab, it enables internet passthrough for VMs in 192.168.10.0/24 (LAN) and 192.168.20.0/24 (DMZ).

**3. Zone-based Firewalls**
The configuration in the VyOS uses zone-based firewalling to organize interfaces into security zones and control traffic between them.
Interfaces are assigned to security zones:
eth0 ‚Üí WAN
eth1 ‚Üí LAN
eth2 ‚Üí DMZ

Default policy is set to drop.  All traffic between zones is denied by default. The firewall rules need to explictly to allow traffic (e.g., LAN to WAN).
This follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring only approved traffic is allowed between zones.

**4. LAN to WAN Firewall Rulesets**

The first ruleset, "set firewall name LAN-to-WAN default-action drop" controls outbound traffic from the LAN zone to the WAN (internet). It follows a default-deny posture and selectively allows essential traffic.
Ruleset 10 allows return traffic for existing connections.
Rulesets 20 to 60 allow traffic for common outbound ports. 
Ruleset 80 was added specifically for this lab to allow ICMP traffic (i.e., connectivity testing using pings)
The rulesets were applied using this command "set zone-policy zone WAN from LAN firewall name LAN-to-WAN"

**5. WAN to LAN Firewall Ruleset**

The first ruleset governs inbound traffic from the internet (WAN) to the LAN zone. It uses a default-deny policy for security and allows only specific, necessary traffic.
It allows return traffic for LAN-initiated connections. This rule is needed because the Entra Connect server (on the LAN) initiates secure outbound traffic to Microsoft Entra ID, and Entra responds.
The rulesets were applied using this command "set zone-policy zone LAN from WAN firewall name WAN-to-LAN".
   
**6. LAN to DMZ Firewall Ruleset**

The first ruleset governs inbound traffic from the internet (LAN) to the DMZ. It uses a default-deny policy for security and allows only specific, necessary traffic
It allows return traffic from DMZ servers that respond to LAN-initiated requests. 
It permits LAN clients to access DMZ-hosted websites on port 80 or 443.  The single test server in this lab is a Ubuntu Web server with a simplae http-based Web page.
The rule is applied using "set zone-policy zone DMZ from LAN firewall name LAN-to-DMZ".

This configuration is done purely for lab/demo purposes to verify web access and network routing. In a production environment, it is strongly recommended to:
- Use HTTPS (port 443) instead of HTTP(80).
- Restrict access by source IP or subnet.
- Enable logging for monitoring.
- Disable or remove unnecessary open ports.

**7. DMZ to LAN Firewall Ruleset**

The first ruleset governs inbound traffic from the internet (LAN) to the DMZ. It uses a default-deny policy for security and allows only specific, necessary traffic
It allows return traffic from DMZ servers that respond to LAN-initiated requests.  
This means DMZ devices cannot initiate connections to LAN ‚Äî but can respond to requests originating from the LAN (e.g., if the Entra Connect server initiates a sync to a web-based admin tool in DMZ).
The rule is applied using "set zone-policy zone LAN from DMZ firewall name DMZ-to-LAN".

This setup is appropriate for lab environments where minimal exposure is acceptable and you need to observe request-response behavior between LAN and DMZ.
Production environments typically block all unsolicited DMZ-to-LAN traffic.  In real-world, additional rules would be added only for required services, such as:
- A secure connection from a reverse proxy in DMZ to an internal identity provider
- DNS or syslog forwarding (tightly controlled)

**8. DMZ to WAN Firewall Ruleset**

**9. WAN to DMZ Ruleset**

**10. Ipv6**
IPv6 fowarding is disabled.
