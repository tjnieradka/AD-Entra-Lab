# 02.VyOS Router Setup

## 1. Introduction

VyOS 1.3 is an open-source, Debian-based network operating system used for routing, firewalling, NAT, DHCP, and VPN services. In this lab, VyOS 1.3 virtual machine acts as the edge router and zone-based firewall, separating the LAN, DMZ, and NAT (labelled as WAN) interfaces. It simulates enterprise-class network segmentation and enforces access rules between on-premises and cloud-connected components (e.g., Entra Connect ‚Üí Entra ID).

## 2. Overview VyOS 1.3 Configuration  

The following configurations were done on VyOS for the lab.  Note that some of the settings were done because this is a lab where VMware environment is shut down when not in use (ie., this is not a production system that stays online all the time).  Some rulesets where done to allow various tests (e.g., ICMP was enabled to allow pings and debugging).

**1. Interfaces**  

The VyOS router is configured with three network interfaces, each representing a separate network zone (set up as different VMware VLANs/virtual networks):  

**eth0 (WAN):**
  - Assigned via DHCP from the VMware NAT or bridged network.
  - Represents the external interface used for internet access.
     
**eth1 (LAN):**
  - Statically assigned the subnet 192.168.10.1/24.
  - Used for internal (trusted) client devices such as AD, Windows, Linux clients.
    
**eth2 (DMZ)**
  - Statically assigned the subnet 192.168.20.1/24.
  - Used for semi-public or isolated servers (e.g., web servers).
    
These interfaces are mapped to separate VMware virtual networks (or VLANs) to simulate zone isolation. The WAN uses the VMware-provided NAT network for internet access.  

**2. Masquerading**  
Two masquerade rulesets were set up.
Masquerading is a type of Network Address Translation (NAT) that allows internal devices (in LAN or DMZ) to access the internet by sharing the VyOS router's WAN IP address.
It rewrites the source IP of outgoing packets to match the WAN interface IP.  In the this lab, it enables internet passthrough for VMs in 192.168.10.0/24 (LAN) and 192.168.20.0/24 (DMZ).

**3. Zone-based Firewalls**  
The configuration in the VyOS uses zone-based firewalling to organize interfaces into security zones and control traffic between them.
Interfaces are assigned to security zones:
eth0 ‚Üí WAN
eth1 ‚Üí LAN
eth2 ‚Üí DMZ

Default policy is set to drop.  All traffic between zones is denied by default. The firewall rules need to explictly to allow traffic (e.g., LAN to WAN).
This follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring only approved traffic is allowed between zones.

**4. Firewall Rulesets**  
The firewall rules are set up in this pattern:
- First rule has the default action to deny traffic. Allowed traffic is explicity defined in later rulesets.
- Second ruleset (i.e., labelled as 10) allows traffic for returning or related connections.
- Additional rulesets define the protocol and destination ports that allow traffic.
- Final command is to apply firewall configuration.
  
**5. Lab Configuration Notes**  
Some of the configurations were done purely for lab/demo purposes to verify web access and network routing.  They are not recommended for production environment.

LAN to DMZ  
In a production environment, it is strongly recommended to:
- Use HTTPS (port 443) instead of HTTP(80).
- Restrict access by source IP or subnet.
- Enable logging for monitoring.
- Disable or remove unnecessary open ports.

DMZ to LAN  
The setup here is appropriate for lab environments where minimal exposure is acceptable and we need to observe request-response behavior between LAN and DMZ.
Production environments typically block all unsolicited DMZ-to-LAN traffic.  In real-world, additional rules would be added only for required services, such as:
- A secure connection from a reverse proxy in DMZ to an internal identity provider
- DNS or syslog forwarding (tightly controlled)

DMZ to WAN  
The current DMZ-to-WAN firewall rule allows all outbound traffic from the DMZ subnet for testing and package updates. This is not a best practice in production environments.
In real deployments:
- Outbound access should be restricted to essential ports (e.g., 80, 443, 123).
- Egress filtering and logging should be enforced.
- Traffic to the WAN should be monitored and tightly scoped.

**6. Ipv6**  
IPv6 fowarding is disabled.


## 3. VyOS 1.3 Configuration
