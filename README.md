## AD–Entra Hybrid Lab (Demo)

A hands-on lab designed to demonstrate **hybrid identity integration** between **on-premises Active Directory (AD DS)** and **Microsoft Entra ID**, including Entra Connect, basic routing with VyOS, and various identity features.

This lab is for **demo and educational purposes** only -- **not meant for production**.

---

## Overview

This repository contains step-by-step instructions to:

- Deploy an **Active Directory domain** (`tntechdemo01.com`)
- Configure a **VyOS router** to isolate zones (LAN, DMZ, WAN)
- Set up **Microsoft Entra Connect** for directory synchronization
- Test Entra-integrated authentication from Windows and Linux clients
- Simulate real-world hybrid join, conditional access, and web services

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller, Entra Connect)
- Windows 11 (test client)
- Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 (Linux test client)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux test Web server)
- VyOS 1.3 (router with zone-based firewall & NAT)
- Virtualization via VMware Workstation

---

##  Important Notes

- This lab is built in a **local, virtualized environment**. Do **not** use real credentials or sensitive info.
- **Firewall rules and routing settings** are simplified for demonstration.
- Certain services (e.g., HTTP access to DMZ server) are intentionally left open to simulate access scenarios.
- **Security hardening, certificate-based auth, and production controls are not applied.**
